## About this repository
Fashion IQ is a new dataset we contribute to the research community to 
facilitate research on natural language based interactive image retrieval. 
We released Fashion IQ dataset at ICCV 2019 workshop on 
[Linguistics Meets Image and Video Retrieval](https://sites.google.com/view/lingir/fashion-iq).

The images can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/hongwang600/fashion-iq-metadata). 

The predicted attributes can be downloaded from [here](https://ibm.box.com/s/koj3z1oxxao3o4mrznyds8cg030brb8r).

For more information on the dataset, please visit its [project page](https://www.spacewu.com/posts/fashion-iq).
